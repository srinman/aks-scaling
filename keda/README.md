## Autoscaling Challenges in Kubernetes Without KEDA

Autoscaling in Kubernetes clusters without KEDA presents several challenges:

1. **Scaling Pods Based on External Events**:
	- Native Kubernetes autoscaling (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, HPA) primarily relies on internal metrics like CPU and memory usage.
	- It cannot natively scale pods based on external event sources (e.g., messages in a queue, database changes, cloud events).
	- Integrating external metrics requires custom solutions, which are complex and hard to maintain.

2. **Scaling to Zero**:
	- HPA does not support scaling deployments down to zero pods; the minimum replica count is usually one.
	- This leads to unnecessary resource consumption when there is no workload.

3. **Complex Metric Integration**:
	- Gathering and exposing custom or external metrics to HPA requires additional components (like Prometheus, custom exporters, or adapters).
	- This increases operational overhead and complexity.

4. **Event-Driven Workloads**:
	- Many modern workloads are event-driven (e.g., processing messages from Kafka, RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus).
	- Kubernetes does not natively support autoscaling based on these event sources.

### How KEDA Addresses These Challenges ([keda.sh](https://keda.sh)):

- KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling) enables autoscaling based on external event sources, not just internal metrics.
- It supports scaling workloads down to zero when there are no events to process, saving resources.
- KEDA provides built-in scalers for many event sources (queues, streams, databases, etc.), making integration simple.
- It works alongside HPA, extending its capabilities to support event-driven autoscaling.

**Summary**:
Without KEDA, Kubernetes autoscaling is limited to internal metrics and cannot scale to zero or respond to external events easily. KEDA solves these problems by enabling event-driven autoscaling, supporting scale-to-zero, and simplifying integration with external systems.
